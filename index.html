                <p>Here Dram of noble soul and broken ship,<br>
                Protector of a fair and fearless charge.<br>
                Standing great and broad against winds that whip,<br>
                Ever first in the fray, a stalwart targe,<br>
                With skin of steel and thundering bellow,<br>
                A paladin of true and righteous heart.<br>
                Yet for Learis, his temper'ment mellow,<br>
                From her he could not bear to be apart.<br>
                A promise to a father, unbroken<br>
                Be it sheild or sword, mentor or lover<br>
                Bound to his daughter, for oaths were spoken<br>
                Until her rightful place he recovers.<br>
                So long as there was breath for him to be:<br>
                Dramiquidon, the guardian of she.</p>
