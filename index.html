            <article class=container>        
                <p>Here Dram of noble soul and broken ship,<br>
                Protector of a fair and fearless charge.<br>
                Standing great and broad against winds that whip,<br>
                Ever first in the fray, a stalwart targe,<br>
                With skin of steel and thundering bellow,<br>
                A warrior of true and righteous heart.<br>
                Yet for Learis, his temper'ment mellow,<br>
                From her he could not bear to be apart.<br>
                A promise to a father, unbroken<br>
                Be it sheild or sword, mentor or lover<br>
                Bound to his daughter, for oaths were spoken<br>
                Until her rightful place he recovers.<br>
                So long as there was breath for him to be:<br>
                Dramiquidon, the guardian of she.</p>
                <p>Born of Charcin from a family great,<br>
                Where wisdom and tradition rule them all,<br>
                Each home was built a fortified estate<br>
                Centered around a warm and cozy hall.<br>
                Yet Dram, he knew, was meant for something more<br>
                His heart aflight with curiosity<br>
                Until his people were swept up in war<br>
                Of many races and atrocities.<br>
                In war he met a true and noble friend<br>
                An inspiration for all to aspire<br>
                Commander of a fleet he would contend,<br>
                The Charcin titled him the Truest Fire.<br>
                Years would pass before he left again<br>
                Leaving Dram and Learis from the campaign.</p>
                <p>A third sonnet goes here.  It will be written when the author is more giving of information...</p>
